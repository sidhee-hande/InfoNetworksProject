They must also swear allegiance to the Constitution of India and its sovereignty and integrity in an oath before the returning officer. Candidates standing from more than one constituency, like Prime Minister Narendra Modi did in 2014, from Varanasi and Vadodara, can take the oath only once (however, the security deposit for the second seat is not returned for such candidates).

            "The Lok Sabha election is likely to be clean and green in Kerala, with the high court banning the use of all non-biodegradable materials, including polyvinyl chloride (PVC) flex boards for the election campaign. The Election Commission has also assured the court that it will ensure that political parties adhere to its directive.The ban order has been issued by a bench of Chief Justice Hrishikesh Roy and AK Jayasankar Nambiar on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by a Thiruvananthapuram native.In his petition, BS Syam Kumar pointed out that the use of these materials violates \"the Environmental Protection Act, 1986  as well as Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016, not to mention the violation of rights of citizens, under Articles 21 and 48A of the Constitution of India, for a clean and safe environment.?? Hence, he pleaded for the ban.Syam Kumar has in particular mentioned the PVC flex boards. \"The use of such PVC flex boards is a key source of pollutants in the forthcoming election, by the political parties/candidates,\" he has said.The petitioner has also drawn the attention of the court to the series of orders passed by Justice Devan Ramachandran of the high court on a bunch of petitions filed by individuals and organisations for the removal of PVC flex boards put up across the state by local authorities.The Election Commission of India, which was the third respondent in the petition, informed the court that it had already asked all the national/regional parties \"to make the forthcoming election eco-friendly and opt for the elimination of single-use plastic materials in the campaign.??The Commission also submitted to the court that it had issued the directive in pursuance of the request made to it by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change \"to impress upon all concerned to take sustainable practices and try using the alternate option to single-use plastic during the election.??In its request to the Commission, the ministry had said, \"A lot of the campaign materials including posters, cutouts, hoarding, banners and political advertisements, etc are made of plastic. After the election, the campaigning materials are discarded and become waste. Such single-use plastic waste generated during campaigning does not get collected and causes choking of drainage and river system, ingestion by stray animals, land and water pollution, open-air burning, etc, leading to adverse impacts on human health and environment. Some of these plastics are Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) based, which produces toxic emissions on burning.??Taking all these into consideration, the bench has ordered: \"All candidates and the National/State Political Parties must strictly adhere to the guideline of the Election Commission, so that only the eco-friendly materials are used during the election campaign and there is no use of PVC flex boards and no other such non-biodegradable materials as campaign materials, in the State of Kerala.\"State Chief Election Officer Teeka Ram Meena has swung into action to enforce the Election Commission?s green protocol backed by the high court.Meena said that at the meeting of political parties called by him to discuss the election code of conduct, he told them that the materials banned by the court should not be used for campaigning. He warned strong action against those who would violate the protocol.As follow-up action, he wrote to all the district collectors, who are district electoral officers, to deploy special squads in the field to monitor whether the political parties follow the court directive.\"On a single day operation alone, we have removed 31,000 flex boards, posters, flags and such other campaign materials made of the single-use plastic from Thrissur district and 8,000 materials form Ernakulam district. They have been handed over to local bodies and (Kerala) Suchitwa Mission for disposal. We are getting compliance reports daily form the district collectors. The public is also very watchful. They too feed us on the violation,?? Meena, a no-nonsense IAS officer known for unbiased-implementation of laws, said.\"In the coming days, we will further strengthen the crackdown and reach even the farthest corners of the state,?? Meena added.Local self-governments in the state have to bear the brunt of the high court order because it will further add to their burden of disposing plastic waste. A Kerala Suchitwa Mission study estimates that presently, the state generates 480 tonnes of plastic waste daily.Local self-governments are struggling to get rid of such a massive quantity of waste for want of proper systems. They are able to collect only a very small portion of it and that will be discarded at their waste dumping yards. While the amount of plastic waste is growing menacingly at all waste dumping yards in the state with the accumulation of daily feed, the uncollected portion is posing a grave threat to open spaces. In fact, all water bodies and land areas are carpeted with plastic waste, the secretary of a city corporation said on condition of anonymity.\"At present, the government-owned Clean Kerala Company is the only agency that collects the plastic waste from local bodies. The company sends the waste to a firm in Tamil Nadu for recycling. Some local bodies in association with Suchitwa Mission have set up plastic shredder units. Since they are able to handle only a very small quantity of the daily generated waste, these steps do not ease the menace,?? he said.Against this backdrop, he said, disposing of the plastic materials seized by the Election Commission, though a minuscule quantity compared to the daily generation, will further fuel the local bodies? trouble.Though this move will escalate their campaign cost, political parties and candidates believe that it is a very sensible move, especially when the state has been facing serious threat form the monstrously growing plastic waste.\"Plastic menace is a reality in Kerala and everybody should support the move to make the state free of it,\" said Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran.Left parties too echo the view of the Congress. \"It is a move to save our state and we should appreciate it,\" said CPI state president Kanam Rajendran.Since the court order had come before the election was officially announced, candidates have not ordered campaign materials made of the court-banned single-use plastic. \"We welcome the move. Luckily, it had come before the campaign was officially kicked off. We have decided to switch over to eco-friendly campaign materials like cloth and paper. It will push our cost up by 20-30 percent,?? said Praveen, the campaign manager of Shashi Tharoor, Congress candidate in Thiruvananthapuram.He is of the view that Kerala should follow suit of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, where relatively lesser money is spent for the campaign.Congress leader and former MLA AA Shukoor, the campaign manager of a former union minister and Congress candidate in Mavelikara Kodikunnil Suresh, said that of the total election cost of a candidate, 40 percent goes in campaigning. But the present court order will further raise the campaign cost.\"We have decided to reduce the number of campaign materials made of costly eco-friendly things. So that we can confine our campaign cost at an advisable limit of 40 percent of the total election cost,?? Shukoor said.Political leaders confided that a candidate of a mainstream political party spends Rs 10-15 crore in Lok Sabha election in Kerala. \"For cash-strapped Congress candidates, it would be impossible to shell out Rs 4?6 crore for campaign this time,?? said a party leader.But flex printers in the state claim that the flex materials contain only five percent PVC and materials containing more PVC are not banned in the state. They say that the court order is very unfortunate.Jerry of Jerry Colour Printers, Kochi, said that eco-friendly flex materials cost double the amount of the plastic ones and printing clarity is also not good. He said that so far, no printers in the state have received orders from candidates.But people in general have heaved a sigh of relief. They expect the order to bring a little relief to Kerala, which is chocked with non-biodegradable waste.Firstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

            "Should Congress president Rahul Gandhi contest from a second Lok Sabha seat apart from his traditional bailiwick of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh? Or will the Congress president sit on his high horse and brave it out only in Amethi?Union minister Smriti Irani will take on Rahul in Amethi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will pull out all stops to wrest the seat from him. Irani cannot be trifled with, as the 2014 election result showed. Rahul won by over three lakh votes in 2009, when Irani wasn't his rival. Then, everything changed in 2014, when she polled over three lakh votes to slash Rahul's winning margin to just over a lakh votes.Despite Amethi's voters being loyal to the Gandhi family for over three and a half decades, the BJP now holds four out of the five Assembly seats that are part of this Lok Sabha constituency. This, and Irani's ability to take the fight into the rival's camp should be deeply worrying for the Congress.Rahul losing Amethi will be a disaster not just for him but also for the future of the Congress and its allies who, in reality, are not many, given that the party has failed to seal seat-sharing pacts with its friends. If the Congress chief fails to make it to the 17th Lok Sabha and the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance retains power, Rahul's humiliation will be complete.To avoid the risk of an adverse verdict in Amethi, the Congress president will do well to contest a second seat. His party unit in Karnataka has formally invited him to contest a seat of his choice in the state.Rahul contesting from a seat in the south makes good political sense. For one, the Congress shares power in Karnataka with the Janata Dal (Secular). And with the two parties finalising a seat-sharing deal, the chances of a safe victory for Rahul are bright.The two parties have also announced a mega rally in Karnataka at the end of March, in which both Rahul and former prime minister HD Deve Gowda of the JD(S) will participate. Leaders of the two parties believe the event will become a big morale booster for the alliance not just in Karnataka but neighbouring states as well.Second, a prime ministerial candidate contesting from the state, Congress leaders believe, will rub off positively on the chances of other candidates from the party.Third, for a leader hailing from the north to contest from the south makes for a good outreach strategy. It will help the Congress drive home the point that their leader has a pan-India outlook, as opposed to Narendra Modi, who in 2014 opted to contest from two seats, neither of which was in the south.Congress leaders, led by former chief minister Siddaramaiah, recall how Karnataka has been a happy hunting ground for the Gandhis ever since 1978, when Indira Gandhi won a remarkable by-election from Chikmagalur against the Janata Party's candidate Veerendra Patil. That victory paved the way for her resurgence and the Congress' sweep in the 1980 general elections.Rahul's mother Sonia Gandhi too won from another seat in Karnataka in 1999, when she scored over BJP's Sushma Swaraj in Bellary. It is another matter that Sonia chose to give up Bellary in favour of her traditional Rae Bareli. Rahul may do the same if he wins from Karnataka.Making the appeal to Rahul, Siddaramaiah tweeted: \"Karnataka has always supported & encouraged @INCIndia leaders. It has been proved in case of Smt.Indira Gandhi & Smt. Sonia  Gandhi. We also want our next Prime Minister @RahulGandhi to contest from Karnataka & herald new developmental paradigm (sic).\"Siddaramaiah has suggested that Rahul contest from Mysuru, the former chief minister's home district.There has been pressure on Rahul to contest from Tamil Nadu too, but if he chooses to stand from a second seat, he will most likely do so from Karnataka, where there are obvious advantages.We haven't heard from Rahul yet, but the clamour for him to contest from the south has led to sniggers from the BJP. Is Rahul running scared from Amethi, they ask. Trolling on those lines will only intensify if Rahul indeed contests from a second seat.Interestingly, rumours were rife on Friday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would contest from Bangalore South but state BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa clarified that no such decision has been taken. A BJP stronghold, Bangalore South was the late Ananth Kumar's constituency. His widow Tejaswini is tipped to contest from there but surprisingly, the party left out the seat from Thursday's list of candidates, leading to speculation that Modi may contest from here.Firstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

            "An announcement by the Janata Dal (Secular) on Saturday that its party chief HD Deve Gowda will contest the Lok Sabha election from Tumkur may have brought an end to days of speculation, but it comes hot on the heels of a fresh problem in the JD(S)-Congress alliance in Karnataka.Hours before JD(S) spokesperson Ramesh Babu spoke of the decision to field the former prime minister as a \"JD(S)-Congress combined candidate\", Congress's sitting MP from Tumkur P Muddahanumegowda said he will file his nomination on Monday as the party candidate from the very seat.The 85-year-old JD(S) patriarch had earlier expressed doubts about contesting the polls, saying he was thinking about his \"usefulness\" in the National Capital. However, he is now expected to file his nomination on Monday, like Muddahanumegowda, in the presence of leaders of the coalition parties.\"All our leaders, workers and elected representatives have unanimously told me that I have to contest. I'm a sitting Member of Parliament. I have delivered on the floor of the House. Why shouldn't I be allowed to contest the election?\" Muddahanumegowda told reporters in Tumkur, adding that he has faith that the Congress and coalition leaders would understand the feelings of the people in his constituency and reconsider their decision.Muddahanumegowda was quoted as having said by ANI that he will hold a procession from BGS Circle in Tumkur to the District Collector's Office on Monday.According to the seat-sharing arrangement between the two parties, of the total 28 seats in the Karnataka Assembly, the Congress will contest 20 and the JD(S), eight. As soon as the seat-sharing pact was announced, Muddahanumegowda, along with Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara, who hails from Tumkur, had requested the JD(S) to give the seat back to the Congress.According to sources, JD(S) bagged the Tumkur seat ? dominated by the Vokkaliga community, its major vote bank ? after a hard bargain as the Congress had decided not to cede constituencies where the party has sitting MPs to its coalition partner.Deve Gowda has ceded the Hassan seat he had been representing to his grandson Prajwal Revanna. There was speculation that he may contest from Bangalore North, though it is understandable that he has chosen to forego it, as most Congress MLAs in the constituency are considered close to Gowda's bete noire Siddaramaiah.The Congress-JD(S) coalition has been in choppy waters since it was formed in May 2018, and the rifts were perhaps irreparably widened when, in January, the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party's botched \"Operation Lotus\" gave rise to renewed suspicions that MLAs from both parties were going to leave for the BJP.  The saffron party, too, had alleged that its own MLAs were being poached and accommodated 100 of its MLAs at a resort in Gurugram until the drama tided over.With inputs from PTIFirstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

When you reach out to them again, you give them an account of your promises,\" the external affairs minister said.Swaraj said to evaluate the work of any government, one should look at its commitment towards three important aspects ? national security, country's development and public welfare. \"On all these three accounts, I would say, our government has proved itself and these are the factors by which voters judge any government,\" she said.\"On the national security front, you saw we had surgical strikes after the Uri attack and the air strikes after the Pulwama attack,\" said Swaraj, who will not be contesting the Lok Sabha polls due to health reasons.The Union minister said the Opposition has often criticised Modi for his foreign visits but it was due to such efforts that India could garner global support in the wake of terror attacks. She also lashed out at the previous Congress-led government over its handling of the situation after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.Swaraj cited the release of Indian Air Force (IAF) officer Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman from Pakistan within two days of him being captured as a \"diplomatic success\" for the country.The IAF officer was captured by Pakistan last month after his fighter aircraft was shot down in a dogfight. Earlier during the meeting, Swaraj heaped praises on Sharma, describing him as her younger brother.\"I am beginning my Lok Sabha 2019 election meetings from Noida today. I feel proud to be seeking votes for Mahesh,\" she said, listing his work as the Union culture minister and the local MP.

In a press conference held by Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, the party launched an offensive on the ruling BJP by citing a report published by The Caravan magazine.According to the report, Surjewala said, former Karnataka chief minister Yeddyurappa had bribed top leadership of the government in 2009. \"It (the Caravan report) mentions the names of senior BJP leaders from Rajnath Singh to (Arun) Jaitley. There is an allegation of a bribe of Rs 1,800 crore on the top BJP leadership,\" the national spokesperson of the Rahul Gandhi-led party alleged.\"Is it true or false?

Surjewala also claimed that the Congress had levelled this accusation in 2017 too, through a video recording in which Yeddyurappa and late BJP leader Ananth Kumar were allegedly heard talking about the paid amount.Surjewala also asked who the \"beneficiaries\" of the alleged bribe from Yeddyurappa were, and said, \"It is a fit case to be investigated by the newly constituted Lokpal.\"Firstpost [0.52538216 0.44801    0.02660776]\n",

            "The Shiv Sena, reports say, has demanded that the Bharatiya Janata Party share seats with it according to the formula the two parties followed over two decades ago, in 1995. In that year, the Sena had contested 171 seats ? 60 percent of the total 288 ? while the BJP contested 117 seats. Times have changed. Now the BJP has 122 seats in the Maharashtra Assembly and the support of 16 other MLAs, making the Sena's demand an outrageous one that the ruling party is unlikely to bend to.BJP president Amit Shah had on Monday reportedly called Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to finalise a seat-sharing agreement before the Lok Sabha polls. The BJP had reportedly offered Shiv Sena a 50-50 seat-sharing formula with an additional Rajya Sabha seat. But the Sena did not agree to it.What the numbers sayIn 1995, the combined forces of the BJP and Sena had secured a total of 138 seats ? the Sena, 73, and the BJP, 65 ? and formed their first coalition government in the state, headed by Manohar Joshi of the Sena and supported by Independents and others. The Sena contested almost 60 percent of the seats while the BJP settled for 40 percent.Since then, there have been four elections to the Maharashtra Assembly. In the 1999 polls, the Sena-BJP alliance won 125 out of 288 and lost to the Congress-National Congress Party alliance, which won 133.In 2004, Sena won 62 and BJP won 54 seats. But this was not enough for the alliance to secure a victory.In 2009, the BJP won 46 and the Sena won only 45, losing to the Congress and NCP's Democratic Front once again.From 73 to 45, the Sena saw a slow slide of its seat numbers during the time when it was an ally of the BJP, which led to its relationship with the party growing increasingly fraught as the time came for the 2014 election.Of the 288 seats in 2014, which the Sena and BJP had contested all 288 seats separately, the BJP won 122 and the Sena won 63. The BJP's Devendra Fadnavis became chief minister. Numerically, the BJP has little reason to agree to the 60-40 model, with its clear 42 percent majority now.The Sena has also been stressing that it will also claim the post of the chief minister once the alliance comes to power. The demand for a Sena chief minister is notwithstanding the number of seats the party eventually manages to win.While the Sena may ultimately settle for 50 percent of the seats, it remains in a perennially taut understanding with the BJP. Within this understanding, the Sena is the natural big brother who, it is almost a given, will impose situations and make extravagant demands off the BJP.While the two parties unite on public stages, like at the rituals preceding the start of construction on the Bal Thackeray memorial in Mumbai which saw Uddhav Thackeray and Devendra Fadnavis shake hands, the Sena's editorial columns on its mouthpiece Saamana are almost exclusively devoted to slamming the BJP and its government at the Centre over its inability on several counts. Issues on which the Sena has recently criticised the BJP range from the party's delay in constructing a Ram temple to the worsening law and order situation in Jammu and Kashmir and from BJP's censure of former JNU Students Union president Kanhaiya Kumar to even the Rafale row.The Sena has never been one to maintain equanimity in the face of disagreements. So while Shah might have made the call to Uddhav as we was keen on stitching a deal ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, the Sena chief may have been determined to negotiate for a package that involves both, reported The Indian Express. While Shiv Sena has contested in states as far away from Maharashtra as Odisha, it has never enjoyed even a fraction of its popularity and electoral success in any other state, leading it to naturally train its entire focus on Maharashtra.Interestingly, a political expert told Times of India that the Sena had, a year ago, passed a resolution in its national executive committee meeting saying it would go solo in all polls in the future. The party, which has not made any announcement adhering to its stand, may just be hoping to fight the polls alone. A protracted snub by the BJP may be just what the Sena is hoping for to fire its workers into a poll frenzy and garner the support of its core electorate in Maharashtra.Sena leader Sanjay Raut told The Times of India, \"They (BJP) can rule in New Delhi, it will be the Sena that will call the shots in Maharashtra.\" Herein, lies the BJP's only reason to consider the party's demands.Maharashtra is a key state for the BJP in its campaign for re-election in 2019, notes a blog post by TK Arun on The Economic Times. While south India remains an area of darkness for the BJP, BS Yeddyurappa's audiotaped lure of the Janata Dal (Secular) MLA has not been paying the party dividends. Meanwhile, the North East remains in turmoil over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill which was brought to the Parliament by the BJP. In several states to the north and northwestern parts of the country, the BJP has either lost recent Assembly elections or is on shaky ground in spite of being in charge of state governments.While the Sena's price is indeed too high, one in the BJP's position would well be willing to pay it to retain control of an integral state that can guarantee it 48 seats in the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha election.Firstpost is now on WhatsApp. For the latest analysis, commentary and news updates, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

            "Chennai: Former Union minister EM Sudarsana Natchiappan who was a contender for the Sivaganga Lok Sabha seat has strongly opposed the party high command's decision allotting it to Karti P Chidambaram, saying people \"hated\" that family.While the names of eight other Congress candidates from Tamil Nadu were announced on Friday, the nominee for Sivaganga was declared only on Sunday evening.Besides Karti, the only other contender for Sivaganga seat was Natchiappan.Natchiappan, who emerged victorious in 1999 Lok Sabha polls defeating H Raja (BJP-runner-up) and P Chidambaram of the Tamil Maanila Congress (who secured the third position), said the decision by the high command has pushed the Congress into a tough situation since Karti Chidambaram was facing \"court case.\"P Chidambaram has won from Sivaganga seven times starting 1984.\"As far as I understand, people hate that entire family (P Chidambaram's family) as they have not done any good for the Sivaganga constituency,\" Natchiappan who was elected twice to the Rajya Sabha (2004, 2010) told reporters. Natchiappan, who is also an advocate, said naming Karti could also be a reason for future problems in the Congress party.A former Union minister of state for commerce and industry, Natchiappan alleged that Chidambaram prevented him from becoming not only the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president but also a minister at the Centre for about nine years (since UPA assumed power in 2004).He alleged that whenever some posts were offered to him, Chidambaram used to opposed it. \"I defeated him and he has it in his mind,\" Natchiappan said.Karti said, \"I have no cases against me in any court, there are only unfounded false allegations against me.\"Speaking to reporters at Sivaganga on Monday, he declined to comment on Natchiappan's remarks against him and his father.Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president KS Alagiri said once the party's top leadership has taken a decision the right course of action will be only to accept it and to oppose the move does not behove well for a leader like Natchiappan.\"If at all he had any grievances, he could convey it directly to the party chief Rahul Gandhi,\" Alagiri said. On 7 February, Karti Chidambaram, was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with a money laundering probe against him in the INX Media case.Officials had said that Karti was summoned to record his statement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. He was grilled a number of times in the case in the past.The ED had attached Karti's assets worth an estimated Rs 54 crore, located in India and abroad, in the case in 2018.The central probe agency had registered the PMLA case on the basis of a CBI FIR and had alleged irregularities in the Foreign Investment Promotion Board clearance to INX Media for receiving overseas funds to the tune of Rs 305 crore in 2007, when his father was the finance minister.
